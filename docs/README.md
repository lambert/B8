![fig_1](prucape.jpg)

## Description

The TI PRU Cape is a BeagleBone Black add-on board that allows users get to know TI’s
powerful Programmable Real-Time Unit (PRU) core and basic functionality.
The PRU is a low-latency microcontroller subsystem integrated in the Sitara AM335x and
AM437x family of devices.
The PRU core is optimized for deterministic, real-time processing, direct access to I/Os
and ultra-low-latency requirements.
It includes LEDs and push buttons for GPIO, audio, and a temperature sensor.
Together the BeagleBone Black and PRUCAPE are an ideal EVM solution to begin PRU development
on the Sitara platform.
